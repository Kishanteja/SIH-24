Deepfake Detection using CNNs
Team Blackwing - Smart India Hackathon 2024
Project Overview
This project is focused on developing a real-time Deepfake detection system that identifies face-swapped videos using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to create a reliable solution that can differentiate between real and manipulated (fake) content with high accuracy.

Problem Statement
Problem Statement ID: 1683
Title: Development of AI/ML-based solution for detecting face-swap-based deepfake videos
Category: Software
Goals
Detect face-swapped Deepfake videos in real-time.
Achieve a high level of accuracy in classifying real versus fake media.
Utilize CNNs for effective feature learning and binary classification.
Technical Approach
Feature Learning:

The model identifies distinguishing features between real and fake images using a triplet loss function, optimizing similarity and dissimilarity between images.
Classification:

A classifier analyzes the learned features and outputs whether the media is REAL or FAKE.
Dataset:

The model is trained on the DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC) dataset, a large dataset of real and fake images for robust performance.
Preprocessing:

Images undergo resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance during training.
Feasibility
CNNs offer strong accuracy (91% validation, 94% training accuracy) and are efficient enough for real-time applications.
They are robust against variations in lighting and facial expressions, making them suitable for real-world deployment.
However, challenges remain with detecting low-quality images or emerging manipulation techniques.
Future Work
Integrating multi-modal detection by combining audio and visual data to enhance performance, especially in difficult conditions.
Continuously updating the model to stay ahead of new Deepfake manipulation techniques.
